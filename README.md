# Snail Survival
Chrome extension javascript game - dodge diving birds and survive.
This Chrome extension presents a simple game where the user controls a snail maneuvering through falling birds. The goal is to survive the descending birds while earning points. The code is primarily written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but mainly JavaScript as the game logic made up most of the work. Allows user to reset after death, tracks the best score, and implements increasing difficulty as the game continues. 

Will be available on the Chrome Web Store.
